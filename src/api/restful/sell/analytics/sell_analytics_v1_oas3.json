This gives sellers the ability to see such things as how often their listing appeared on eBay, how many times the listings are viewed, and how many purchases were made. In addition to the information requested, the traffic report contains general information about the criteria eBay used to generate the report (such as the report's start and end dates and the basis of the report). In the report itself, the metrics.key field shows the metric being returned, with each records container holding the dimension and metric values for each of the metrics in the report. You can generate two types of traffic reports; one based on days and another based on listings. Generating a report based on days For this report, you set dimension to day, specify the marketplace_ids and the date_range filters and specify the metrics (metric) you want returned. The following is an example of a request based on days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dimension=DAY&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter=marketplace_ids:%7BEBAY_US%7D,date_range:%5B20160814..20160824%5D&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metric=LISTING_IMPRESSION_SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE,LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE Note: The specified dimension value is returned in the dimensionKeys.key field of the response. Generating a report based on listings and sorting by a metric For this report, you set dimension to LISTING, the filter, the date_range, specify the metrics (metric) you want returned, and a metric you want sorted (sort).

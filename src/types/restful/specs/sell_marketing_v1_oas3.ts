Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but note that no API interface changes have been made.</span><br>This method creates an <b>item price markdown discount</b> (know simply as a "markdown discount") where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included in the discount. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.  <p>Unlike an <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/item_promotion/methods/createItemPromotion">item discount</a>, a markdown discount does not require the buyer meet a "threshold" before the offer takes effect. With markdown discounts, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the discount benefit.</p>  <p class="tablenote"><b>Important:</b> There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown discounts. For details, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements">Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions</a>. <br><br>In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown discounts. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the <b>Growth</b> tab in Seller Hub.</p> <p>There are two ways to enable items for markdown discounts:</p> <ul><li><b>Key-based discounts</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to include.</li>  <li><b>Rule-based discounts</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>New discounts must be created in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or a <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the <b>promotionId</b> is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a discount that's in a DRAFT state).</p>  <p class="tablenote"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html">Discounts Manager</a> in the <i>Selling Integration Guide</i> for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller discounts.</p>  <p>Markdown discounts are available on all eBay marketplaces.

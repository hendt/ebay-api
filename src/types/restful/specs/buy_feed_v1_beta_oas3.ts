The Content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. In addition to the API, there is an open source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file. Note: The response is always a TSV_GZIP file.

An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. There are two types of item group feed files generated: A daily Item Group feed file containing the item group variation information associated with items returned in the Item feed file for a specific day, category, and marketplace. (feed_scope = NEWLY_LISTED) A weekly Item Group Bootstrap feed file containing all the item group variation information associated with items returned in the Item Bootstrap feed file for all the items in a specific category.

When curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied as they can be changed or removed in the future. The contents of these feed files are based on the contents of the corresponding daily Item or Item Bootstrap feed file. When a new Item or Item Bootstrap feed file is generated, the service reads the file and if an item in the file has a primaryItemGroupId value, which indicates the item is part of an item group, it uses that value to return the item group (parent item) information for that item in the corresponding Item Group or Item Group Bootstrap feed file. This information includes the name/value pair of the aspects of the items in this group returned in the variesByLocalizedAspects column. For example, if the item was a shirt some of the variation names could be Size, Color, etc. Also the images for the various aspects are returned in the additionalImageUrls column. The first line in any feed file is the header, which labels the columns and indicates the order of the values on each line. Each header is described in the Response fields section. Combining the Item Group and Item feed files The Item Group or Item Group Bootstrap feed file contains details about the item group (parent item), including the item group ID itemGroupId. You match the value of itemGroupId from the Item Group feed file with the value of primaryItemGroupId from the corresponding daily Item or Item Bootstrap feed file.

        /** @description This method uses a user access token to place a proxy bid for the buyer on a specific auction item. The item must offer AUCTION as one of the buyingOptions. To place a bid, you pass in the item ID of the auction as a URI parameter and the buyer's maximum bid amount (maxAmount ) in the payload. By placing a proxy bid, the buyer is agreeing to purchase the item if they win the auction. After this bid is placed, if someone else outbids the buyer a bid, eBay automatically bids again for the buyer up to the amount of their maximum bid. When the bid exceeds the buyer's maximum bid, eBay will notify them that they have been outbid. To find auctions, you can use the Browse API to search for items and use a filter to return only auction items.

The transactionStatus filter must be used. All other filters are optional. transactionStatus: the data returned in the response pertains to the sales, payouts, and transfer status set. The supported transactionStatus values are as follows: PAYOUT: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) have been paid out to the seller's bank account. FUNDS_PROCESSING: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are currently being processed. FUNDS_AVAILABLE_FOR_PAYOUT: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are available for a seller payout, but processing has not yet begun. FUNDS_ON_HOLD: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are currently being held by eBay, and are not yet available for a seller payout. COMPLETED: this indicates that the funds for the corresponding TRANSFER monetary transaction have transferred and the transaction has completed. FAILED: this indicates the process has failed for the corresponding TRANSFER monetary transaction. Below is the proper syntax to use when setting up the transactionStatus filter: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionStatus:{PAYOUT} transactionDate: only consider monetary transactions that occurred within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionDate:[2018-10-23T00:00:01.000Z..2018-11-09T00:00:01.000Z] Alternatively, the user could omit the ending date, and the date range would include the starting date and up to 90 days past that date, or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past. transactionType: only consider a specific type of monetary transaction. The supported transactionType values are as follows: SALE: a sales order. REFUND: a refund to the buyer after an order cancellation or return. CREDIT: a credit issued by eBay to the seller's account. DISPUTE: a monetary transaction associated with a payment dispute between buyer and seller. NON_SALE_CHARGE: a monetary transaction involving a seller transferring money to eBay for the balance of a charge for NON_SALE_CHARGE transactions (transactions that contain non-transactional seller fees). These can include a one-time payment, monthly/yearly subscription fees charged monthly, NRC charges, and fee credits. SHIPPING_LABEL: a monetary transaction where eBay is billing the seller for an eBay shipping label. Note that the shipping label functionality will initially only be available to a select number of sellers. TRANSFER: A transfer is a monetary transaction where eBay is billing the seller for reimbursement of a charge. An example of a transfer is a seller reimbursing eBay for a buyer refund.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a monetary transaction type: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionType:{SALE} buyerUsername: only consider monetary transactions involving a specific buyer (specified with the buyer's eBay user ID). Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific eBay buyer: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=buyerUsername:{buyer1234} salesRecordReference: only consider monetary transactions corresponding to a specific order (identified with a Selling Manager order identifier). Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Selling Manager Sales Record ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=salesRecordReference:{123} Note: For all orders originating after February 1, 2020, a value of 0 will be returned in the salesRecordReference field. So, this filter will only be useful to retrieve orders than occurred before this date. payoutId: only consider monetary transactions related to a specific seller payout (identified with a Payout ID). This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=payoutId:{5000106638} transactionId: the unique identifier of a monetary transaction. For a sales order, the orderId filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction(s) associated with this transactionId value are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific transaction ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionId:{03-03620-33763} orderId: the unique identifier of a sales order. For any other monetary transaction, the, the transactionId filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction(s) associated with this orderId value are returned.

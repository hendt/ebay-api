        "description": "<p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, refer to the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-landing.html\">Promoted Listings playbook</a>.</li><li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as \"20% off\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p><p><b>Store Email Campaign</b> allows sellers to create and send email campaigns to customers who have signed up to receive their newsletter. For more information on email campaigns, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/store-email-campaigns.html#email-campain-types\" target=\"_blank\">Store Email Campaigns</a>.<p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the \"requirements and restrictions\" sections for <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements\">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p>",

The seller must also identify the items they want to place in the campaign by adding the listing id of each item in the <b>listingIds</b> array of the request. <br><br>Using the provided <b>listingIds</b>, eBay creates ad groups for the campaign and organizes the listings into the appropriate ad group. eBay then adds keywords to each ad group and assigns each keyword a suggested bid. <br><br>By default, campaigns created using <b>setupQuickCampaign</b> utilize a <code>FIXED</code> keyword bidding strategy which means that a seller manually assigns and adjusts keyword bids for their CPC campaign.<br><br>Alternatively, once the campaign has been created, sellers may opt to utilize a <code>DYNAMIC</code> bidding strategy which means that eBay will manage a campaign's keyword bids and automatically update them daily to the suggested bid.<br><br>For additional information about <code>FIXED</code> and <code>DYNAMIC</code> bidding strategies, refer to <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/campaign/methods/updateBiddingStrategy \" target=\"_blank\">updateBiddingStrategy</a>.<br><br>Campaigns created using this method will be in <code>DRAFT</code> status upon creation.<br><br>The location response header returned contains the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/campaign/methods/getCampaign\">getCampaign</a> URI to retrieve the newly created campaign that is in draft status.

The items you specify, using either <b>listingId</b> or <b>inventoryReference</b> values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report.<br /><br />For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-reports.html\">Promoted Listings reporting</a>.<br /><br />This call returns the URL to the report task in the <b>Location</b> response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID.<br /><br />Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of <code>202</code>, which indicates the report is being generated.

When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to <b>SUCCESS</b> and you can download it using the URL returned in the <b>reportHref</b> field of the <b>getReportTask</b> call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of <code>.tsv.gz</code>.<br/><br/><span class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note:</b> The reporting of some data related to sales and ad-fees may require a 72-hour (<b>maximum</b>) adjustment period which is often referred to as the <i>Reconciliation Period</i>.

Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but note that no API interface changes have been made.</span><br>This method creates an <b>item price markdown discount</b> (know simply as a \"markdown discount\") where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included in the discount. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.  <p>Unlike an <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/item_promotion/methods/createItemPromotion\">item discount</a>, a markdown discount does not require the buyer meet a \"threshold\" before the offer takes effect. With markdown discounts, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the discount benefit.</p>  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important:</b> There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown discounts. For details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions</a>. <br><br>In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown discounts. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the <b>Growth</b> tab in Seller Hub.</p> <p>There are two ways to enable items for markdown discounts:</p> <ul><li><b>Key-based discounts</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to include.</li>  <li><b>Rule-based discounts</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>New discounts must be created in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or a <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the <b>promotionId</b> is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a discount that's in a DRAFT state).</p>  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Discounts Manager</a> in the <i>Selling Integration Guide</i> for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller discounts.</p>  <p>Markdown discounts are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions</a>.</p>",

Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but note that no API interface changes have been made.</span><br>This method creates an <b>item discount</b>, where the buyer receives a discount when they meet the specific buying criteria. Known here as \"threshold discounts\", these discounts trigger when a threshold is met.  <p>eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the discounted items throughout the online buyer flows.</p>  <p><i>Discounts</i> are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price of a listing, letting you offer deals such as \"Buy 1 Get 1\" and \"Buy $50, get 20% off\".</p> <p><i>Volume pricing</i> discounts increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase.</p> <p><i>Coded Coupons</i> provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller's Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller's Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media).</p> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note</b>: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.</p><p>There are two ways to add items to a threshold discount:</p>  <ul><li><b>Key-based discounts</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to be discounted.</li> <li><b>Rule-based discounts</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain the items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>You must create a new discount in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the promotion ID is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests.</p>  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Selling Integration Guide</a> for details and examples showing how to create and manage threshold discounts using the Discounts Manager.</p>  <p>For information on the eBay marketplaces that support item discounts, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions</a>.</p>",
